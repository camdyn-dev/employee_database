When I first started programming, I was stuck in that stage where you're spending 3x more time on material searching
compared to actually writing code. Of course, there were a bunch of fantastic resources right in my face (automate the
boring stuff, python crash course), but I was stubborn and kept looking, eventually finding this course on Udemy with
like 600 reviews.

It was a really tough course, but not for the right reasons. The materials were
super lacking and the teaching style was pretty poor; like, the professor was implementing OOP before
teaching us objects and list methods, and when he did teach us list methods, he spent literally 9 minutes going through
all of them. Needless to say, when I hit this project I had NO idea what I was doing, so after like 3 days of chipping
away at it, I kinda gave up and went back to studying infosec.

A few months later, I got a significantly better course (with
a different focus, web development) and things finally started clicking together, and I ended up getting
much, much further than I did with the last course. Today, I was looking through my udemy log and ended up finding
this, so I wanted to give it another crack. I think I did pretty well this time.
